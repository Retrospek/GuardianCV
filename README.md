# GuardianCV

## Inspiration
Emergency rooms are stressful environments where nurses need to track incoming patients in a fast-paced setting. This process is called **patient triaging**. What if there was a tool that could triage patients automatically based on visual characteristics (like level of injury) and electronic health records?

## What It Does
**GuardianCV** streamlines triage by leveraging:
- Generative AI
- Computer Vision
- Cloud Services

It aims to analyze visual indicators of patient injuries and integrate with electronic health records for faster, more accurate triaging.

## How We Built It
- **AWS**: Cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
- **Python**: Core logic and AI/ML processing.
- **OpenCV**: Computer Vision capabilities to detect and interpret patient injuries.
- **Next.js**
